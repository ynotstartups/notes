# Cheat Sheet Work

## Number of working days per 2 week sprint

Working hour is from 9:00 - 12:30, 13:30 - 18:00, which is 3:30 + 4:30 = 8 hours per day.

In a 2 week sprint, we have the following meetings.

Week 1, Monday, stand-up, 20 minutes
Week 1, Tuesday, retro, 20 minutes
Week 1, Wednesday, backend sync, 60 minutes
Week 1, Thursday, 1-on-1, 45 minutes
Week 1, Thursday, cross squad stand-up, 30 minutes
Week 1, Thursday, company all hand, 60 minutes
Week 1, Friday,  stand-up , 20 minutes
Week 1, Friday,  engineering all hand , 60 minutes
Week 2, Monday, stand-up, 20 minutes
Week 2, Tuesday, stand-up, 20 minutes
Week 2, Wednesday, membership all hand, 60 minutes
Week 2, Wednesday, Scrum of Scrums, 30 minutes
Week 2, Wednesday, Sprint Planning, 60 minutes
Week 2, Thursday, cross squad stand-up, 30 minutes
Week 2, Friday,  stand-up , 20 minutes

In these 2 weeks, we have 8 * 10 = 80 working hours, minus all the meetings, 555 minutes = 70 hours 45 minutes. 70 hours are able 8.75 working days, we spent about 1.25 working days in meeting.

If we further spent 60/90/120 minutes daily on distractions, we have 7.5/7/6.5 working days left.

```
60 * 10 = 600 minutes, 70 hours 45 minutes - 600 minutes = 60 hours 45 minutes, 60 hours / 8 hours per work day = 7.5 working day

90 * 10 = 900 minutes , 70 hours 45 minutes - 900 minutes = 55 hours 45 minutes, 55 hours / 8 hours per work day = 7 working day

120 * 10 = 1200 minutes, 70 hours 45 minutes - 1200 minutes = 50 hours 45 minutes, 50 hours / 8 hours per work day = 6.5 working day
```

Flexible working guide is open for interpretation, e.g. we don't have a punch clock to enforce working hour.
