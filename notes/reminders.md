## Short Term Reminders

- learn how to touch type, because I am not happy that the large amount of mistakes during typing, which also hinders my experience with Vim.

  - 30 minutes of touch type exercise per day
  - `touch-type` - to open image guide
  - [Website to learn](https://www.edclub.com/sportal/program-1.game)
    - 100% accuracy to pass a lesson
    - restart if use the wrong finger
    - list keys typed with wrong fingers,  esc, delete, c,
    - [Correct Posture](https://ergonomictrends.com/proper-ergonomic-typing-posture-at-computer/), Cannot type properly if the posture is wrong.

- read vim `:help user-manual` per day

**Vim Features To Try Out**

- use fugitive to view file in another branch - `Gedit branch-name:path/to/file`
- disable vim number to force myself to use jump list
- `:mak[e]` -- run make commands and populate quickfix
  - quickfix understands patterns like `src/mobile_api/modules/obsessions.py:346:` in the stdout
- `:helpgr[ep]` -- search help text files
- `:col[der], :cnew[er]` -- Go to the older/newer quickfix list.
- `:stag` - open tag in split
- Use vim arguments list to manage the list of files
  - use `:argadd`, `:argdelete` to add and remove opened file
  - `[a`, `]a` to go to previous and next argument files
  - `argdo {cmd}` to do operation
    - `:argdo %s/foo/bar/g | update` to run search-replace-save argument files
- use abbreviations `:abbr lunix Linux` as simple snippet?

## Long Term Reminders

- Stop buying unnecessary items
- Straighten my back
- Write down important facts about people
