# What Am I Doing Now?

- Read _The Priory Of The Orange Tree_ by Samantha Shannon
- Continue writing these notes

## Short Term Reminders

- read one vim `:help user-manual` per day

**Vim Features To Try Out**

- use fugitive to view file in another branch - `Gedit branch-name:path/to/file`
- disable vim number to force myself to use jump list
- `:mak[e]` -- run make commands and populate quickfix
  - quickfix understands patterns like `src/mobile_api/modules/obsessions.py:346:` in the stdout
- `:helpgr[ep]` -- search help text files
- `:col[der], :cnew[er]` -- Go to the older/newer quickfix list.
- `:stag` - open tag in split
- Use vim arguments list to manage the list of files
  - use `:argadd`, `:argdelete` to add and remove opened file
  - `[a`, `]a` to go to previous and next argument files
  - `argdo {cmd}` to do operation
    - `:argdo %s/foo/bar/g | update` to run search-replace-save argument files
- use abbreviations `:abbr lunix Linux` as simple snippet?

## Long Term Reminders

- Stop buying unnecessary items
- Straighten my back
- Write down important facts about people
