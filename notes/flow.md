# Flow

Reading notes from Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

## What is flow?

Flow is the state when I immerse in doing an activity and lost the track of time or any biological need, such as hunger.

The more often I can be in the flow state, the more happy I am and the more self development there is.

In order to obtain the flow state, I need to do activities with complete attention.

I need to eliminate distractions.

It's equally important to have immediate feedback during or at the end of the flow activities, for example, at the end of a coding session, programs are the feedbacks, at the end or during the dish washing, dirty dishes become spotless.

## A Question

is there activities which I cannot 'flow' because there is no
immediate feedbacks from these activities? Then if I am able to figure out
a way to have immediate feedback then I can enjoy these activities? What
about drawing? Exercise? Q

## What do I do to remove distractions?

- I have [removed time](https://github.com/ynotstartups/dotfiles/blob/a2c6fd28f037b8eae4743a5c3767c6eb9a9795b6/i3status-config#L16) from my computer's desktop.
- turn off notifications
- put phone away
