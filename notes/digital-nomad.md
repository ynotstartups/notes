## Half Digital Nomad

This is not a fully developed idea.

The definition of half digital nomad. 

- have a home (a permanent place to stay)
- but travel X months per year

Instead of being full digital nomad, meaning traveling all year round, it might be simpler to be a half digital nomad. For example, emotionally, you can a physical place to call home, a place to put things that are not easy to travel with.
