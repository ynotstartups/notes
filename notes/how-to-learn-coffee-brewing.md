# How To Learn Coffee Brewing 

**Coffee Beans**

The most important of coffee broking is to use high quality coffee beans.

The easiest way is to buy beans from popular specialty coffee shops. 

**Grinder**

I started with a cheap Hario coffee grinder, but after 2 months, I switched to a more expensive one 1Zpresso. It was a good decision, I cut the coffee grinding time from 3 minutes to 40 seconds!

So my recommendation is to start with a good grinder if you drink coffee daily. 

**Coffee Brewer**

You also need a coffee brewer, I only have experience with Aeropress, so I cannot say much here.

I choose Aeropress because it can make Cappuccino. Moka Pot can make Cappuccino too but Aeropress seems safer, easier and more versatile because Aeropress can make both black coffee and Cappuccino.

The youtube videos are all very useful for me to learn about coffee brewing.
