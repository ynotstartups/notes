# Progression Via Books

## The Question

How do we know we are progressing in life?

TODO: better describe the problem of hard to trace progression in life

## Realisation

I realised that I saw progress on my self when I finish reading a book, or completed any other medias (e.g. articles, tv series, movies...).
See `./reading.md`.

## What is The Big Idea?

Progression in life is simplified to the cycle of finishing a book and choosing next book to read.

## How to execution this idea?

Then reading the right books becomes critical, time is limited.

The simple answer is to read classics.

## Example 1

I work as a backend engineer, what are the classics for software engineering?

- A Philosophy Of Software Design
- Cloud Design Patterns - Microsoft Azure Docs
- Database Internals: A Deep-Dive Into How Distributed Data Systems Work
- Designing Data-Intensive Applications
- Domain-Driven Design
- Introduction to Algorithms - Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein
- Pro Git - Scott Chacon And Ben Straub
  Structure And Interpretation Of Computer Program
- Test Driven Development
- The C Programming Language By Brian Kernighan And Dennis Ritchie

## Example 2

What are the things that I do in work? What are the books that I should read?

ADR,API Design,Android,Markdown, RST,UI/UX Design,aws,bash,circleCI,communications,confluence,ctags,django, orm (object-relational mapping layer), drf, middleware,,django otm,django-ninja,docker,docker-compose,git,github,networking, http, ip, load balancer, auth ...,refactoring,analytics,iOS,image processing,ipython,jira,kubernetes,linux,locale?,make,managements,microservices architecture,mypy,networking,wsgi,poetry,postgres,project management,testings, unit tests, end2end test,pytest,python,python virtual env,redis,running meetings,sqs queues,tech lead,vim,writing documentations,writing tickets,yaml, monitoring, kibana, newrelic, sentry

Modern technology is very complex, so understand the underpinning fundamental scales better, in other words, learning from the bottom up instead of top down is the only possible solution.

## Conclusion

It is daunting that they are so many classics, however I cannot expect to gain progress just by reading them.

To effectively learn, I need to understand the theory and also to be able to practice.

Choose a book that's most relevant to work at hand and then read and practice.
