# Progression Via Books

- When I look back on the books that I finished or not finished, I know those are my own progress
  - Other medias (e.g. articles, tv series, movies) be recorded too, if they turned out to be influential on me
- Then life or life progression is simplified to choose the next books to read
- Reading the right books are critical, though it is not difficult
  - the simple answer is to read classics
- e.g. I work as a backend engineer, what are the books I should read?

- it seems daunting that they are so many classics that I should read but there is no point to painstakingly go through them one by one. I think to effectively learn something, we need to understand the fundamental and the theory as well as practice, so choose a book that's most relevant to work at hand and then read and practice.
- modern technology is very complex, so understand the underpinning fundamental scales better, in other words, learning from the bottom up instead of top down is the only possible solution
