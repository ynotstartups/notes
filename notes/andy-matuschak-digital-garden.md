# Andy Matuschak's Digital Garden

[Notes by Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes)


- This website share the same user interface with [ranger's user interface](https://github.com/ranger/ranger/wiki/Official-User-Guide#User-interface-), the main windows consists of three panels, it is called Miller Columns.
- Hover on link of this website presents a preview window, this is quite powerful to have a sense of what the link is about, but it is also a bit distracting.
- It has a great implementation of [bi-directional links](bi-directional-links.md)

The web interface really helps me to explore the related contents and makes me have a sense of falling down a rabbit hole.
