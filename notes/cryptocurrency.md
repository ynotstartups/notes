## Why don't I invest in Cryptocurrency?

1. I don't understand how it works technically
1. Hyped
1. High risk, it might mean high reward but I am not looking for high return in the short term, I am happy with slow and steady grow of investment. It's important to understand the [end goal of my investments](cheat-sheet-investments.md)
1. Difficult to choose a platform to invest
1. Need to have physical wallet
1. Service fees are high
1. Investment platform has no direct debit, so I cannot automate the investments
7. Not proven work in the long term (30 years +)
