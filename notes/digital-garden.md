# Digital Gardening

Digital garden are forever work in progress/developing personal notes.

All these notes are interlinked to allow exploration of ideas.

## What is digital garden?

[A brief history](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)

## Why do I write these notes?

- practise writing
- build the habit of writing
- record my random thoughts

George Orwell gives the following [four reasons](https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/why-i-write/) on why every writer writes.

**Sheer Egoism**

This is very true for me, when I was in primary school, Chinese and English are my worst subjects. I might just want to show that I can write and I can speak English.

**Aesthetic Enthusiasm**

Good writings are just beautiful.

**Historical Impulse**

These notes record my random ideas, for whatever reason, my brain is running most of the time, new ideas constantly pop up in my head, just want to write them down.

**Political Purpose**

> using the word ‘political’ in the widest possible sense. Desire to push the world in a certain direction, to alter other people’s idea of the kind of society that they should strive after. Once again, no book is genuinely free from political bias. The opinion that art should have nothing to do with politics is itself a political attitude. -- George Orwell

## Remind myself the following when writing

> A scrupulous writer, in every sentence that he writes, will ask himself at least four questions, thus: What am I trying to say? What words will express it? What image or idiom will make it clearer? Is this image fresh enough to have an effect? And he will probably ask himself two more: Could I put it more shortly? Have I said anything that is avoidable ugly? 

> 1. Never use a metaphor, simile or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
> 2. Never use a long word where a short one will do.
> 3. If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
> 4. Never use the passive where you can use the active.
> 5. Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
> 6. Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.
>
> -- Politics and the English Language, George Orwell

- Do not be afraid to write down raw thoughts, because I can always develop it later


## How does this site work?

Perhaps unlike other websites, this site works more like a open source software and this [Digital Garden Idea](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

- Every note is always work in progress
- Every note is by default public on day 1, similar to the idea [open source by default](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2018/08/21/OSS-by-Default-Docs/)

## Infrastructure

My notes are several markdown files in a folder called `notes` within a [Github repository](https://github.com/ynotstartups/notes). By using `MkDocs`, I setup a `pre-push` git hook to publish `notes` folder to Github page.

I use `exiv2` to remove all Exif (GPS) data from images in `pre-commit` git hook.

I value the simplicity of this setup.

Because I have been writing code in Vim for years and I recently got used to writing documentations in Vim, so writing these notes in Vim feels easy and natural to me. I don't need any mental transition to write notes.
