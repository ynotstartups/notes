## A Short Intro

- I'm from Foshan, China, spent all of my adult life in London.
- I’m an introvert by nature and spend my weekends mostly at home.
- Started in mathematics, then transitioned to computer science.

## What are my super powers?

- **Empathy**: I care about others, and want others to success.
- **Communication**: I like to write, but I don't know if the writings are good though.

## What are my quirks?

- **Introvert**
  - I am afraid to talk to people that I am not familiar with.
  - Sometimes uncomfortable/nervous during socials.

## What do I value most?

- **Growth**: I want to learn new things and get exposed to new knowledge every day.
- **Life Insights**: Deep conversations, I want to understand more about life and human experience.

## What do I enjoy working on?

## How do I prefer to work?

## How am I like to work with?

## How do I prefer to communicate and get feedback?

- 2-minutes: I might ask you for 2-minutes to bounce an idea off you, or to rubber duck. 2-minutes is usually 10 - 30 minutes. 15-minutes = “We have a problem.”
- Face-to-face: Writing just doesn’t convey the message well enough, the facial expressions and tone matter.
- Feedback: I enjoy feedback early and often. My default qns - “What should I do more of? What should I do less of/stop doing? What can I improve on?”
- I believe feedback is a gift and will not take offence; I don’t need the shit sandwich around it.
- When giving others feedback, I prefer to give it in a private, casual setting, preferably 1-on-1.
