# How To Play Welcome To

**finish the three city plans with as little turns as possible**

- do so by drawing fences optimally such that when you complete one city plan (by building estates) then you will get other city plans completed
- don't worry about completing all the rows at all
- it is okay to use one or two bis
- starts with row 3 because it is more likely to provide spaces for two or more city plans
