# Neomutt Cheat sheet

## Key bindings

| Command | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| `*`   | Move to last entry   |
| `/`   | Search  |


## Find email sent from myself

Use limits, like filter, by hitting `l` and enter a search query

`~f myemail@gmail.com`

## Find email where subject contains a word

`/ foo`, better if you first filter the emails with limits above
