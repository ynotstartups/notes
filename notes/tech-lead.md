# Tech lead

A team Lead is not about being on the top in term of hierarchy, but at the front of the team,  like a leader of adventure, when there is a blocker, you need to jump in and unblock the, and direct the team to the right direction. 

It's not about the end goal, it is all about the journey, just enjoy the day.
