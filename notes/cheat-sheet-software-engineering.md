# Cheat Sheet Software Engineering 

## naming variable

- Don't use `new`

## Reminders

- Read documentation/manual/user’s guide before using a new tool/cli
- Be more curious about understanding how things work
- Write comment first
- Main goal is a great design rather than just working codes, then writing comments should be fun since that’s how you identify the best design
- Interface documentation v.s. Implementation documentation
- Design it twice
- Does the abstraction reduce complexity?
- Always ask for agenda for meetings so that I can be better prepared
- I am bad at ac-hoc talk and thinking 
- API endpoint should be Noun, such that it can support GET and POST, say if it is `save_search`, then the POST is for saving the search, but the GET will be weird .. 
- Data that’s not backed up is lost (could be due to an incorrect command or hardware failure )
- validate assumptions earlier
