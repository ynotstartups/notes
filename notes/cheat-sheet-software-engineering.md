# Cheat Sheet Software Engineering 

## Being a Tech Lead

> A team Lead is not about being on the top in term of hierarchy, but at the front of the team,  like a leader of adventure, when there is a blocker, you need to jump in and unblock the, and direct the team to the right direction.

> Act as a shepherd, looking after the team and steer them loosely in the right direction, rather than enforcing all my idea.
> -- Jon Pither, Talking With Tech Leads

It's not about the end goal, it is all about the journey, so enjoy the day.

Tech Lead brings value by

1. enabling everyone on the team to contribute code as much as possible
1. by avoiding rewrites due to people working in different ways
1. by managing tech debt to make it easier to add code
1. by promoting relationships between the development group and business colleagues to ensure the code addresses business goals and delivers true value

## How to run daily stand up?

1. open jira
1. yesterday
1. meetings for today
1. today
1. going through the tickets in the jira board person by person
   1. keep jira board up to date
   1. discuss progress
   1. identify blockers
1. anything else that's not in jira, but try our best to capture all works in jira tickets

## How to run retrospective?

1. open miro board
1. setup a 5 minutes timer for the team to add tickets
1. group tickets in similar theme
1. discuss tickets in sections
1. setup vote for star of the sprint

## How to run sprint planning?

- [ ] üé´ Before planning, create placeholder BE, iOS, Android tickets for refinement follow up
- [ ] üé´ Before planning, create 4 QA tickets, regression for iOS, regression for Android, smoke test for iOS and smoke test for Android
- [ ] announce public holidays
- [ ] ask if anyone has holiday plan
- [ ] open jira
- [ ] going through current sprint person by person
- [ ] pull in tickets from groomed tickets in backlog
- [ ] plan for next sprint by BE, iOS, Android, Data Science, QA...
  - [ ] estimate tickets
  - [ ] pull in tickets for the next sprint
- [ ] count **Estimates** for each person to make sure they are realistic

## How to run sprint refinement?

- [ ] ask designer to join refinement
- [ ] optional - designer explain upcoming project
- [ ] groom/explain ticket in the grooming section of backlog
  - the idea for refinement is for all of us to understand the tickets
- [ ] ask for bug tickets and tech debt tickets from developers want to do next sprint
- [ ] ask if there will be other tickets not in grooming yet from products, QA
- [ ] anything else?

Notes:

- No need to come up with estimate during refinements, estimates are required during planning

## Jira Setup

- Columns:
  - TO DO - selected tasks for current sprint
  - IN PROGRESS - in progress tasks
  - CODE REVIEW - opened PR and waiting for review
  - QA
  - DESIGN REVIEW - ticket first goes to QA for checking both functional and design and then it goes to the design review for PM and designers for the final gate check
  - DONE - completed

## Estimates

- Number of days for one engineer, assuming no meetings
- With this definition, an engineer can do 8 points for a 2 week sprint

## Meetings

- Standup at 10:20 everyday
- Weekly Metrics Sync at 10:40 on Thursday
- Two Week Sprint
  - Week 1: Retrospective at 10:00 on Tuesday
  - Week 1: Refinement at 10:00 on Thursday
  - Week 2: Sprint Planning at 15:00 on Thursday

## API Workflow

1. Draft API Design Doc
1. setup meeting with FE to discuss API
1. iOS & Android to agree on API

## Tech Lead Behavioural Ideals

- jira
  - all ongoing tasks should be in Jira
  - breakdown large tasks into subtasks in Jira board
  - initial estimates needs to be accurate, spend time thinking about estimates after refinement and before planning
- Before Standup
  - üîé Focus on 3 most important things on each day
  - üéâ Prepare at least one celebration
- My role is to remove obstacles, manage the stakeholders, and clear a path to incrementally improve the system. In return I expected everyone to be professional, speak out when they felt things weren't right, and respect the ideas of shared ownership.
- If I am doing my job right, you should not feel my existence.
- I consider myself a facilitator instead of a leader.
- Only needs to do 3 things:
  1. Provide (training, motivation, resources, opportunities, etc.)
  1. Remove (blockers, confusion, politics)
  1. Get Out Of The Way.
- Bring Positive Energy! Celebrate wins!
- Need to be realistic on deliverables
- establish best practices for software development
- make all tech member in the team happy
- help product to communicate requirements with the tech team
- to tell the team in stand-up
  - `Thursday: planning today, spend sometime to understand the tickets from backlog or refinement and think about the estimate before planning`
  - `Friendly Reminder: We have refinement today, have a think about any tech debt and bug tickets that you want to discuss and bring into next sprint.`

## Topics for 1 on 1 with Product Manager

- What tickets / work are coming up in the sprint planning ?
  - so that I can prepare the tickets for the next sprint and not be surprised if the priority suddenly changed
- What tickets / work are coming up in the refinement?
- Team delivery / performance
- Feedbacks
- Blockers
- Ongoing Issues
- Ongoing Experiments A/B tests

## Topics for 1 on 1 with Manager

- Spending training allowance

## Required tickets for new epic / project

- [ ] Add Epic Ticket for project
- [ ] BE, iOS, Android: follow up action from refinement meeting
- [ ] BE, iOS, Android: spikes for uncertainties
- [ ] BE, iOS, Android: breakdown tickets with estimates
- [ ] QA              : BDD scenarios
- [ ] BE              : design API, agree API with iOS and Android
- [ ] BE              : implement API
- [ ] PRODUCT         : heimdall requirements
- [ ] BE, iOS, Android: heimdall
- [ ] BE, iOS, Android: heimdall Cleanup
- [ ] PRODUCT         : new analytics requirements
- [ ] BE, iOS, Android: analytics
- [ ] PRODUCT         : share experiment analysis

## Standup

- prepare pen and paper
- prepare cheatsheet folder
- üéâ celebrate
- üîç 1 focus on
- üîç 2 focus on
- üîç 3 focus on

## Scrum of Scrums

- Scrum of Scrums
  - Update of the sprint that affects other teams
  - Are there new obstacle / Blockers?
  - Things that might affect our teams

## Engineers Tech Sync

- [ ] what are the technological unknowns that we have?
- [ ] what are the confusing flow that we have?
- [ ] reminder to break down tickets and add estimates

## Software Engineering Tech Ideals

- 100% code coverage
- documentations
- strict typing
- detailed tickets

## General Reminders

- Read documentation/manual/user‚Äôs guide before using a new tool/cli
- Be more curious about understanding how things work
- Write comment first
- Main goal is a great design rather than just working codes, then writing comments should be fun since that‚Äôs how you identify the best design
- Interface documentation v.s. Implementation documentation
- Design it twice
- Does the abstraction reduce complexity?
- Always ask for agenda for meetings so that I can be better prepared
- I am bad at ac-hoc talk and thinking
- API endpoint should be Noun, such that it can support GET and POST, say if it is `save_search`, then the POST is for saving the search, but the GET will be weird ..
- Data that‚Äôs not backed up is lost (could be due to an incorrect command or hardware failure)
- Validate assumptions earlier
