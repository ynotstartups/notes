## An App With User Contributed Instructions to Clean Everything

This app contains instructions such as [how to clean french press](how-to-clean-french-press.md) and [how to clean bathroom](how-to-clean-bathroom.md).

Imagine cooking recipe apps with step by step instructions with photos, but instead of cooking recipes, it is instructions for cleaning.

Because not everyone knows to how clean things effectively, for example, I don't know to clean shoes.

Existing apps are all todo lists, for example, [this](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/spotless-a-simply-cleaner-home/id1067203863), [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.looploop.tody&hl=en_GB) and [this](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mmproductions.cleaningchecklist&hl=en_GB).
