# Random Wisdoms

## On Life

Learn and do things that benefit me for the rest of my life, such as vim, Linux, personal finance..

The most precious thing you can give away is your time.

Discover the life that I want other than merely copying from other people.

If you read news the world is hell, if you don't read news the world is heaven.

Lots of people go to the gym to hedge against the unhealthy lifestyle

Computer programs are all about automation, whenever you find yourselves repeating, find a way to automate it.

It's less about how shiny the tool is, it is about how deep you understand the tool. (Example, you don't need the latest iphone. You don't always need the latest version/hyped software)

## On things to buy

1. Be durable
1. be easy to dispose of either by selling, giving away, or trashing in a responsible manner
1. Be small and preferable lightweight
1. Be serviceable locally and easy to maintain and repair preferably by yourself

## On why exercise

- live 20 years longer
- more muscle

## On writing

Writing is not never done in one sitting, instead write a bit every now and then, then you just need to rearrange them into longer form writing. (Learning from How to Take Smart Notes.)

The end goal for everything is always about writing? Literally everything! Living, playing games, watching movies, eating out in Michelin restaurants.

## How to learn everything

1. read
1. think
1. write it down

## On marriage

There are certain parallels between a script with an article, a CLI program with a podcast and a GUI program with a video.

The parallel is on the time they take to do and the information they convey.

## Great things take a lifetime to do

Such as marriage, career, investments ... (TODO)

If you are rushing anything, just stop, take a deep breath, do it slowly.

## Compounding

Good thing such as minimalism, terminal based programs (bash, vim, grep, ls
...) and investing is hard to see return in value in the short term, but
instead they work more like compound investments, it is only after 3 - 5 years,
I start to see the benefits, so picking the right things to do, as well as,
not giving up is very important.
