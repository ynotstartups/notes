# Who am I?

My name is Tiger Yuhao Huang.

Welcome to my [digital garden](digital-garden.md)!

I am starting a new job as python backend engineer at Saltus!

I consider myself a [minimalist](minimalism.md), [see my possessions](all-things.md).

My biggest hobby is [home cooking](cooking.md), [coffee brewing](tasted-coffee-beans.md) and [eating out](restaurant-recommendations.md). I also find washing dishes to be meditating :)

I am also interested in
[reading](reading.md),
[writing](digital-garden.md),
[coding](https://github.com/ynotstartups),
[personal finance](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1u54y1x7zF),
art,
classical music,
...

My wildest dream is to open a cafe called "Tou",
it sells Man Tou, black filter coffee, latte.

Ginger and I had made some videos during lock down, see our [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQE6i7tcSbBQMD8KSeUQYvQ) and [bilibili channel](https://space.bilibili.com/1281157300).

## Meaning Of Life

I believe that the meaning of life is to be alive.

I once thought the meaning of life is to enjoy every moment of life, but I don't think it is true any more because there were good days and bad days so it wasn't always possible to enjoy it.

But being alive (please do try your best) let you experience life in both its beauty and the ugly. Life is your unique experience with the world and every choices you made.

Others also believe in this idea.

> The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious and so simple. And yet, everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were necessary to achieve something beyond themselves.
