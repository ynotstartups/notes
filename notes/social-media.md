# Social Media

## Why don't I use social media

- I feel stressful on the `like` feature

When my post gets a lot of likes, then I get stressful to have the next post perfect.

When my post gets too little likes, then I get stressful to think if there is something wrong with my post.

- people are too beautiful, people's life are perfect

- more time to focus on what I want instead of what others want

- Social media can be judgemental on the things that I post, I can post whatever I want in a personal website
