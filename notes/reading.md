## Books that change my life

**Outliers**

Outliers started my journey of reading books at 17 years go.

I own this to a English tutor because I was not able to pass the IELTS English exam for university.

**The life-changing magic of tidying**

This book makes me start practising minimalism, thank you Marie Kondo!

**Intelligent investor**

It jump-started my investment journey, I am still applying investment philosophy.
