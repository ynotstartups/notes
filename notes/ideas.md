# Ideas

The idea of this idea documentation is to note down the random ideas I have and add use case when one idea turns out to be common and worth solving.

Time is limited, we cannot simply do all of our random ideas, otherwise, nothing can be achieved.

We need to find out the fundamental theme of these ideas and then perhaps we can find a solution that fixes multiple problems instead of individual problems, similar to how one runs `retro`.
