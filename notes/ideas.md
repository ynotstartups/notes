# Ideas

The idea of this idea documentation is to note down the random ideas I have and add use case when one idea turns out to be common and worth solving.

Time is limited, we cannot simply do all of our random ideas, otherwise, nothing can be achieved.

We need to find out the fundamental theme of these ideas and then perhaps we can find a solution that fixes multiple problems instead of individual problems, similar to how one runs `retro`.

## Random Ideas

- book: Thinking, Fast and Slow - Daniel Kahneman
  - learn about human behaviours
  - learn about decision making
- Vim: Caser Plugin don't remove dash `-` when using `gst`
  - useful in markdown to preserve the list syntax, such as this one at the front
  - I do want the dash in the title e.g. The C Programming Language - Brian Kernighan And Dennis Ritchie
- Vim: Buffer Management, Don't know what Vim buffer I have, use leader B to open the list of buffers?
  - it can use as reminder to see what files I am working at too
- Vim: Visual In Indent
  - useful in markdown, when I want to sort a list of items, such as below, so `viIndent` then `<leader>s` to sort
    - a
    - b
    - c
- Markdown: Sort by indent To Format File such as this one?
