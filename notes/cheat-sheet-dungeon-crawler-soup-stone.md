## Tips

**Attributes**

At levels 3, 9, 15 etc ...

Choose an attribute to raise:

- Strength - makes heavy armour less cumbersome and slightly increases weapon damage
- Intelligence - makes your spells more reliable and powerful
- Dexterity - increases your evasion and stealth

**Magic**

At experience level 1, only level 1 spells are available. This will change as your gain experience. Find and pick up spellbooks, then spells will be added to library.

Cast spells with z.

Spells like ammo, are shown in the quiver slot, so I can use Q to ready a spell in the quiver. Use f to fire the currently quivered spell.

Use I to check magic failure rate.
