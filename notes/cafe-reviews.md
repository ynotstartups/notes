# Specialty Coffee Review

## My Favourite

If you prefer coffee with fruity taste then try Ozone Coffee Shoreditch,
or if you prefer roasted taste try Monmouth Coffee.

## Monmouth Coffee - Covent Garden

[website](https://www.monmouthcoffee.co.uk/shops/)

The filter coffee, tastes are layered, first, strong roasted flavour, second, a sudden fruity sourness, lastly a long lasting tea like aftertaste.

## Ozone shoreditch

Great food, very impressive aeropress filter coffee

## OMOTESANDO Koffee London

[website](http://ooo-koffee.com/london.html)

Three choices of filter coffee, two washed, one natural.

Minimalistic decoration

Coffee is great but it is served with paper cup.

## Origin - Southwark

Sour, badly brewed filter coffee

## Prufrock

Too sour to my taste, not too impressive

I [brew coffee](coffee-recipe.md) at home myself too!
