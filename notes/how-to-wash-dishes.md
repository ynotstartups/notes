# How To Wash Dishes

1. remove things from drying rack
1. groups similar type of tableware, for example, group plates and knifes together
1. line up the tableware
1. clean one by one

## Why group similar type of tableware?

Because different types of tableware require different cleaning strategies,
when I group the same type together, I am able to apply the same strategy for that specific type multiples time
and then move on to the next type.

This is more efficient.
