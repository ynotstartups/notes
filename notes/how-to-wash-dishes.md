# How To Wash Dishes

1. remove leftovers from tableware, such as bones
1. pour water into dry dirty dishes, this makes them easier to clean
1. remove things from drying rack
1. place cutting board first
1. groups similar type of tableware, for example, group plates and knifes together
1. line up the tableware
1. clean one by one

## Why place cutting board first?

Because it uses up a large space of the drying rack, easier to clean it and place it on drying rack first.

## Why pour water into dry dirty dishes?

Water dissolve dry sauce on dirty dishes, making them easier to clean.

## Why group similar type of tableware?

Because different types of tableware require different cleaning strategies,
when I group the same type together, I am able to apply the same strategy for that specific type multiples time
and then move on to the next type.

This is more efficient.
