# Talking With Tech Leads

## Practitioners

With a role split across several dimensions, effective time-management becomes even more important, so, I asked each person to share their own approach. They describe where to find time, how to identify tasks, strategies for delegation and, most importantly, how to maintain the delicate balance of heads-down time in code and juggling their other responsibilities.

A set of people does not make a team. It only exists as a group.
A team is a set of people working towards a common goal.
An effective leader aligns people towards that goal.

Focus on growing developers, common practice is to meet one-on-one with each developer to find out

- what their interests are
- what motivates them
- what they consider their strengths
  With this information, the Tech Lead constantly seeks ways to match interests and opportunities across the team.

Appreciates different strengths that each person brings to the team.

Make myself redundant: I work to ensure the team has the skills, knowledge, and experience to run itself. There are a couple of reasons for this: I want my teams to self-organise as much as possible; it gives them a greater feeling of empowerment. It meas the team can operate without an overseer, so I can have confidence, should I go on leave to get ill, that things will operate smoothly. Just as importantly, it also frees me up to look at boarder concerns and add more value at a higher level.

My main worries as a Tech Lead are usually about people engagement. Technical problems are rarely insurmountable, in my experience. People problems are much more complex.

The term Tech Lead is ambiguous: some consider the Tech Lead to be the lead programmer; some see it as a synonym of software architect. Whatever term you use, the role should focus on putting together the high-level architecture of the software system, taking care to understand any requirements or constraints that influence the architecture.
