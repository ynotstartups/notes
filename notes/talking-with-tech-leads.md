# Talking With Tech Leads

## Practitioners

With a role split across several dimensions, effective time-management becomes even more important, so, I asked each person to share their own approach. They describe where to find time, how to identify tasks, strategies for delegation and, most importantly, how to maintain the delicate balance of heads-down time in code and juggling their other responsibilities.

A set of people does not make a team. It only exists as a group.
A team is a set of people working towards a common goal.
An effective leader aligns people towards that goal.

Focus on growing developers, common practice is to meet one-on-one with each developer to find out

- what their interests are
- what motivates them
- what they consider their strenghs
  With this information, the Tech Lead constantly seeks ways to match interests and opportunities across the team.

Appreciates different strengths that each person brings to the team.
