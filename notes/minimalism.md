# Minimalism

## How do I become a minimalist?

I become a minimalist after reading [The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-effective-clutter/dp/0091955106/ref=asc_df_0091955106/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310834580283&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11869604209145403320&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9041110&hvtargid=pla-492265979689&psc=1&th=1&psc=1) and watching [Japanese tv series](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5362450/) which describes a more extreme form of minimalism...

## On Processions

I own a small amount of things, more importantly, all of them are my favourites. This leads to me being constantly happy and satisfied with my living spaces.

Because of the small amount of things, I have a designated place for each item.
This is quite useful because it makes my home easy to clean and to find things.

Some people shop to reduce stress, I don't have much desire to obtain more things, so instead, I reduce stress to throwing things away.

Because I don't have the urge to buy things, I have a large proportion of my salary leftover every month, then I learned about FIRE, see below.

## On Finance

Minimalism is also anti-consumerism, this enables me to start the journey of Financial Independence, Retire Early.

> Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) is a movement of people devoted to a program of extreme savings and investment that aims to allow them to retire far earlier than traditional budgets and retirement plans would permit. -- investopedia

Applications of minimalism in investing:

- automatic investment using direct debit
- minimalistic portfolio consists of two funds

## On household cleaning

It makes cleaning easier because

1. My living room is almost empty so mopping the floor is easy
1. When cleaning [bathroom](how-to-clean-bathroom.md), I can first put away every things in the bathroom surfaces.

## On how to live my life

- Don't have social media
- Go to restaurant once per month
- Order delivery once per month
- Go to brunch once per month

## My Minimalism Ideals

Just a sofa & a table

**Bed Room**
