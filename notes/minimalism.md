# On Minimalism

## How do I become a minimalist?

I become a minimalist after reading [The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-effective-clutter/dp/0091955106/ref=asc_df_0091955106/?tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=310834580283&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=11869604209145403320&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9041110&hvtargid=pla-492265979689&psc=1&th=1&psc=1).

## On Life

I own relatively little things, I have a designated place for each item.
This is quite useful because it makes my home easy to clean and to find things.

Applications of minimalism: 

- So little clothes that I need to do laundry twice per week
- Go to restaurant once per month
- Order delivery once per month
- Go to brunch once per month
- Don't have social media

## On Finance

Minimalism is basically anti-consumerism, this leads to start the journey of Financial Independence, Retire Early.

> Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) is a movement of people devoted to a program of extreme savings and investment that aims to allow them to retire far earlier than traditional budgets and retirement plans would permit. -- investopedia

Applications of minimalism: 

- simple investment strategy

## On household cleaning

It makes cleaning easier because 

1. My living room is almost empty so mopping the floor is easy
1. When cleaning [bathroom](how-to-clean-bathroom.md), I can first put away every things in the bathroom surfaces.

## Quotes from friends 

> Your flat looks like a sample flat.

> Your bathroom feels like the one in hotels.
