# Writing style guide

All of these rules need to be enforce by markdown linter and formatter.

## Headers

Title `#` use capital letters in every words.

Section title `##` use sentence style.

Bold `****`, TODO, I don't know.

## lists

```
-
-
-
```

and

```
1.
1.
1.
```
Should the first character be capital case or not?

## Titles

A markdown file must have one and only one title `#`

## Sections

Don't use header 3 `###`

## Avoid Words

Avoid words such as `try to`

## Notes Naming

Put note type first and topic second, e.g. `cheat-sheet*.md`, `how-to*.md`.

Because this makes default output of `ls` nicer.

## Comma

No space before comma and one space after comma
