# Automation

Thinking about adding a script to do some automation.

Let's first start with work related automation.

I currently have

- `a`    - to print out agenda of the day,
- `jira` - to print out reminding tickets

## Use cases

- based on the meeting that I have, print out the checklists for those meetings.
  - For example, I have refinement/planning today, print out the checklist for refinement/planning.
  - For example, I have 1 on 1 with product manager/manager, print out talking point with product manager/manager
  - when there is a refinement or planning today, print out reminders in Standup for team members
  - on the Monday that has refinement, add todo to ask if relevant designer has time to join refinement
- when there is a new project, print out a list of required tickets for the new project
- template for heimdall/experiment clean up tickets?

## Requirements

- markdown based, more specifically based on [cheat sheet software engineering](./cheat-sheet-software-engineering.md), so that I just need to update the markdown file
