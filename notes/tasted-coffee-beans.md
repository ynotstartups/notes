## Lichia

A cup bursting full of apricot-like qualities.
Long-term relationships underpin our approach to coffee sourcing. Being open. Listening. Learning. Paying fairly. Working together to create an outstanding cup. This lot produced by Virgulino Muniz in Brazil, is a perfect example of that. Our partnership spans over 11 years and each year his crop seems to get better.

Named Lichia as it’s grown in an area on the Das Almas farm that is full of lychees, it has a Icatu varietal and was processed using an anaerobic fermentation technique. This involves placing washed coffee cherries in an airtight container to ferment for almost 3 days before being placed outside to dry. This method increases the acidic qualities and structure in the final cup which is bursting full of apricot-like qualities.

It’s so exciting to see Virgulino trying new innovative practices on a farm that been central to our work for so many years.

## Tuberosa Decaf

This coffee is decaffeinated using an all-natural Sugarcane process.

Tuberosa is a collective effort by various small holders located in the Antioquia region of Colombia. Coffee from this region is special because it is grown in an ideal microclimate, with relatively cold weather and rich, mountainous soils. When choosing lots we look for coffees like Tuberosa that will work specifically well when decaffeinated; coffee that can undergo the Sugarcane process and still retain incredible flavour clarity in each cup.

This coffee is decaffeinated using our new and the all-natural Sugarcane process. This involves pressurising and expanding the coffee beans with light steam, before it's rinsed in Ethanol Acetate (EA), an organic compound created by the fermentation of non-GMO Colombian sugarcane. Mountain water and steam are then added to remove any remaining caffeine before the coffee is dried and delivered to the local quality control lab to grade quality.

## Barokah

The Barokah Cooperative sits at the foot of Mount Kerinci, the highest active volcano in Indonesia. This area is located in the Ring of Fire, a path of over 450 volcanoes that wraps around the Pacific Ocean which is highly unstable with frequent eruptions and plate movements. Despite the unique environment, the volcanic soil is extremely lush and fertile, making it the perfect terroir for growing outstanding coffee.

The natural process requires the fewest number of steps at the washing station. Cherries are picked before being placed on patios to dry. They are then moved again onto raised beds which provides shade and better airflow. Typically, this process heightens the sweetness in the final cup.

Expect pronounced strawberry and grapefruit notes that sit alongside a long caramel-like finish.

## Elvis

The 36 hour fermentation creates crisp raspberry acidity alongside citrus complexity.

We started our journey in Peru two years ago with our local partner Falcon Specialty. Falcon only works with producers, who aren’t members of a cooperative, association or organisation. These producers are the most vulnerable since they don’t have access to training sessions or premiums for quality or certifications, and their income is totally dependent on the market price..

This coffee is produced by Elvis Tineo Rafael, a second-generation coffee producer in El Diamante. We met him on our last trip and shared coffee and lunch together, to discuss his process.

His coffee was washed and floated before being macerated in the cherry for 12 hours, which provides more sweetness to the coffee. The coffee was then dried under shade for 15 days. This process intensifies the acidity and transforms the final coffee to provide a crisp mouthfeel and sugary sweetness.

## San Fermin

San Fermin is what we call a ‘session coffee', something you can drink all day long.

San Fermin is a lot built from dozens of small producers in south Tolima. Etched out of the mountains, situated in some of the most remote locations each farm is only a few hectares. Farmers must cross rivers and trek through jungles before they can load dirt bikes and carts pulled by donkeys, to get the coffee to our partners at the local warehouse.

The producers of San Fermin are a key part of who we are, and we have two ongoing projects that celebrate that relationship. Our yearly producer competition recognises these truly exceptional lots. Additionally, we have committed to purchasing a drier with our local partners, Caravela. This will save the producers having to return the coffee all the way back to their farms if it still needs some further drying, saving them extra time and effort.
