# Turner Contemporary - Margate, England

## Toppled plastic chair on a pink platform

This toppled chair made me smile, at the same time, I was wondering if it is accidental.

I don't know if the pink flower graffiti on green (or blue) wall is part of the art work, but the wall, flower, chair and platform merge into one coherent work. My favorite piece in the whole exhibiting!

## Another Time - Antony Gormley

On the first day afternoon, the sculpture is fully visible.

Next day morning, the sculpture is not visible because it is fully immerse in water.

Next day afternoon, the sculpture is half visible.

The visibility depends on the tide.

This is such a ingenious use of natural phenomena, the tide becomes part of the sculpture. I am very amazed to see sculpture can part of nature, or nature can be part of the sculpture. This changes my impression of the dark, cold, hard, unwelcoming sculptures. Ironically, this sculpture is indeed made from iron which is dark, cold, hard and unwelcoming.
