## Story

I brought some Expresso blend by mistake (I brew with aeroprees so ideally
filter blend would be better.)

But throwing away the beans would be too wasteful, I
got a V60 brewer, so I decided to learn brewing with V60.

The brewed coffee don't taste good, due to my inadequate V60 technique.

I can't drink them because it's 10pm. I thought instead of throwing away
the coffee, let's leave all of these coffee in the fridge and see if they
taste better with milk.

At the end I came up with this cold brew recipe...
