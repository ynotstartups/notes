## Board Games V.S. Video Games

Board games and video games are two totally different medium, both of them can be enjoyed in different circumstances.

Below are the differences between board games and video games in general, of course there are always exceptions.

1. board game rules can be understood in minutes
1. board games are purely brain exercise, no requirements for dexterity, hand eye coordination and muscle memory, so they can be enjoyed with a diverse audience in different ages groups, without common languages, and not require familiarity with technology
1. board games can finish in 10-30 minutes
1. board games have physical presence
1. board games can be placed in a larger surface compared to small monitor
1. board games require a smaller initial investment, boardgames prices are around 20 pounds

## Board Game Arena

Board game arena is a website to play boardgames with friends, highly recommended!

- affordable pricing model (Â£27 yearly , one premium member can open table to allow free members to join)
- simple to learn/use interface
- eliminated setup, point counting
- plenty of games (see [premium games](https://boardgamearena.com/premium) for popular board games)

Ginger and I own the physical copy of Targi, however because of the time consuming setup and the point counting at the end of the game, we have only played the physical copy 3 times.

But when we started playing Targi in Board Game Arena, we can play 3 games in less than an hour! So we kept playing, we have played at least 20 games now..

See [this thread in boardgamegeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2491575/tabletop-simulator-vs-tabletopia-vs-board-game-are) for a detailed comparison of Tabletop Simulator vs Tabletopia vs Board Game Arena.

**Bonus**

I wrote a [scraper](https://github.com/ynotstartups/bga-scraper) for all the games Board Game Arena and added this google sheet. For each game, it contains the name, link to Board Game Arena, whether it is premium, number of players, average duration and complexity rating.

## Board Game To Try Next

- Puerto Rico, similar gameplay with argicola
- The Castles Of Burgundy
- Agricola - complex and long game

## Board Game Not Considering

7 Wonders Duel - rules for each icons, too many icons

Onitama - too Chess like

Pandemic - too many rules, the rules are not elegant - best for 2

Race & Roll for the Galaxy - complex - best for 3
