# Talking With Tech Leads

## Quotes

With a role split across several dimensions, effective time-management becomes even more important, so, I asked each person to share their own approach.

Make myself redundant: I work to ensure the team has the skills, knowledge, and experience to run itself. There are a couple of reasons for this: I want my teams to self-organise as much as possible; it gives them a greater feeling of empowerment. It meas the team can operate without an overseer, so I can have confidence, should I go on leave to get ill, that things will operate smoothly. Just as importantly, it also frees me up to look at boarder concerns and add more value at a higher level.

The term Tech Lead is ambiguous: some consider the Tech Lead to be the lead programmer; some see it as a synonym of software architect. Whatever term you use, the role should focus on putting together the high-level architecture of the software system, taking care to understand any requirements or constraints that influence the architecture.

Early on, I thought the only issues were code issues. Over the years, I have realised that the majority of our issues are communication issues. So I try to be as effective a listener as possible first, and secondly as effective a communicator as possible.

Honesty, transparency, and humility will always serve you well.
