# Cheat Sheet Investing

All quotes are from The intelligent investor

## beat the averages is very hard

> Since anyone -- by just buying and holding a representative list -- can equal the performance of the market averages, it would seem a comparatively simple matter to "beat the averages"; but as a matter of fact the proportion of smart people who try this and fail is surprisingly large. Even the majority of the investment funds, with all their experienced personnel, have not performed so well over the years as has the general market. Allied to the foregoing is the record of the published stock-market predictions of the brokerage houses, for there is strong evidence that their calculated forecasts have been somewhat less reliable than the simple tossing of a coin.

## have a simple portfolio

> In writing this book we have tried to keep this basic pitfall of investment in mind. The virtues of a simple portfolio policy have been emphasized -- the purchase of high-grade bonds plus a diversified list of leading common stocks -- which any investor can carry out with a little expert assistance. The adventure beyond this safe and sound territory has been presented as fraught with challenging difficulties, especially in the area of temperament. Before attempting such a venture the investor should feel sure of himself and of his advisers -- particularly as to whether they have a clear concept of the differences between investment and speculation and between market price and underlying value. 

## foresight has no value

> "Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profit for investors." While it seems easy to foresee which industry will grow the fastest, that foresight has no real value if most other investors are already expecting the same thing. By the time everyone decides that a given industry is "obviously" the best one to invest in, the prices of its stocks have been bid up so high that it's future returns have nowhere to go but down. 

## don't look at the stock prices

> The true investor scarcely ever is forced to sell his shares, and at all other times he is free to disregard the current price quotation. He need pay attention to it and act upon it only to the extent that it suits his book, and no more. Thus the investor who permits himself to be stampeded or unduly worried by unjustified market declines in his holdings is perversely transforming his basic advantage into a basic disadvantage. That man would be better off if his stocks had no market quotation at all, for he would then be spared the mental anguish caused him by other persons' mistakes of judgement.

> When asked what keeps most individual investors from succeeding, Graham had a concise answer:" The primary cause of failure is that they pay too much attention to what the stock market is doing currently." 

## earn enough money is the end goal of investing

> Page 220
> The whole point of investing is not to earn more money than average, but to earn enough money to meet your own needs. The best way to measure your investing success is not by whether you are beating the market but by whether you've put in place a financial plan and a behavioral discipline that are likely to get you where you want to go.  In the end, what matters isn't crossing the finish line before anybody else but just making sure that you do cross it.
