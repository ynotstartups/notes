# Life Organization

Life is all about making choices. Here are mine.

## Notes

**Pen and Post-it notes**

Quick, traditional, can practise handwriting

**Google keep**

Fastest option when I have no access to pen and paper.

## Short term TODOs

**Google Keep**

I used android and got a widget in my phones desktop, it is quick and simple to use. I used it to write down my random idea and random thinking, and when I have more time later on, I will either move it to Jira of it is a mid to long term project or delete the idea if it turns out to be no value.


## Email

**Gmail**

Didn't remember why I picked gmail.

Just works for me, so no complain.

## Browser

**Chrome**

It is faster than Firefox in my opinion, and I am quite deep into Google's Ecosystem, so Chrome is convenience for me.

## Phone

**Pixel 3a**

I once quite like iPhones, but I was disappointed with the lack of innovation after iPhone 6 so I gave up on Apple, my iPhone 6 stopped working so I picked a cheap but high quality android phone.

Pros

- cheap
- just works
- not Apple

## Websites

**Github Pages**

I have been using Github pages since 2016, didn't really try other options, just works.


## Keyboard

**Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional HYBRID Type-S**

I was once told HHKB is the best keyboard every programmer wanted in the my year of university, that sentence stuck in my head for more than 5 years, I resisted mechanical keyboard for a long time, but I was having problem with MacBook Pro 2019's keyboard then I decided to buy HHKB in Christmas 2020. Easily one of my best decision in life.

Pros

- has Bluetooth
- the color scheme is old school and aesthetically beautiful

## Mouse

**Logitech G305**

I want to replace it with a bluetooth keyboard.

Pros

- cheap
- wireless

Cons

- needed a USB connector

## Laptop

**MacBook Pro 2019 but with Linux installed**

## Operation System

**Ubuntu with i3 window manager**

Working beautifully for me

## Speaker

**MARSHALL Emberton Portable Bluetooth Speaker Black**

My friend had a portable Bose, it sounded quite nice. Did some research, ended up with this one.

## Projector

**Xgimi**

2021 Birthday present from Ginger 

## Phone Carrier

**Three**

It had unlimited 3G package in 2013, was appealing to me.
But now I choose pay as you go instead because WiFi is everywhere and I realised I don't need to call nor to message too much.

## Instant Messages

**Wechat**

I am Chinese :) 

**WhatsApp**

My friends use it so I need to.

## Music

**Youtube Music**

Works well with adblocker

## Version Control

**Github**

First one version control for me, I started using it in 2014, it just works for me.

## Main Programming Language

**Python**

I started coding as a data analysis, python was the best choice for data analysis.
I remember I learned python before my first uni internship by reading O'REILLY Learning Python book. I am lucky to use python in all of my jobs so I might be stuck with python for the rest of my life.

## Editor

**Vim**

*Pure necessity*

In my first company, we don't use cloud so we need to ssh into remote server to edit files, and the only available tool is vim.

*Suits my value*

Suits my idea about learning things that can last for the rest of my life, vim is a editor that can last forever.
When I started coding, I used Sublime then I moved to Atom for a bit but I realised that each new editor will be replaced at some point.
But Vim is already 30 years old and it is still going strong.

*Looks cool*

Thinking that I can edit code in terminal is very cool, aesthetically beautiful, and motivating idea for a 21 year old.


## Toothbrush

Normal toothbrush works great for me. Electric toothbrushes are annoying because we need to charge it from time to time.
And I feel like electric toothbrushes company brought up tooth clinics to push their products.


## My Fashion Style

Interesting/unique but not over the top
