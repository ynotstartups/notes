*Senior*

- technical lead for the team responsible for ingesting our data streams and presenting them in a usable format for other teams, this includes both making them available in real time and persisting them in a time-series database for after the fact analysis. The main technical challenges relate to reliable and efficient entity identification, maximizing throughput and minimizing latency, and presenting the data in an easily retrievable fashion.

Previously, I was the technical lead for a team also responsible for the auto-trader, price feed and position management systems. The new projects that my current team manages grew large enough, and we split that team into two one being my current team. During my time working on those projects, they increased significantly in reliability, performance, observability and scalability.

Alongside the directly technical responsibilities, I also mentor members of my team and do some project management to ensure we are working on the correct things in the correct order.

## Prepare for questions

Q: You will have the opportunity to explore your own ideas and suggest new tools. Should we parse input data using something from the standard library? Would we be better off using a third party tool like ANTLR or Ragel? Could we use regular expressions, or would that just give us two problems? Would a quick sed script get the job done? Is the best solution to store output data in a relational database? Would a NoSQL store be a better fit for this problem, or could we use something hierarchical like HDF5? The answer will vary depending on the problem and you’ll be expected to investigate the options to find a good solution.
