# Cheat Sheet Writing

## How to v.s. Cheat sheet

`How to` - step by step guides on how to do something,
e.g. [how to clean bathroom](how-to-clean-bathroom.md)

`Cheat sheet` - short concise answer to a question,
e.g. [vim cheat sheet](cheat-sheet-vim.md)

## Paraphrase

Don't just copy paste or quote! Paraphrasing with my own words, this makes me internalise the idea.

## Who, What, When, Where, Why and How

Answers these when writing!

## Avoid Links

links are distracting. Links stop readers' flow, the readers are tempted to go away to read the link. Links have a different formatting, physical books don't work like that.

## Avoid using quotes `>`

Quotes change formatting too, it is distracting, in physical book, it is done by, `As someone wrote`...

## Creating index

Create index when there are five notes in the same topic.

## Writing index

Write a story instead of just a dull list of pointers to notes

## Noting ideas from brain

Write down the exact idea instead of writing `remember to write down foo idea`.

This finished half of the writing already so I am more inclined to transfer the idea to notes. This avoids the mental effort of pulling out the idea from brain.
