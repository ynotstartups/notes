## My Journey with coffee beans

I started with [Square Mile Roaster](https://shop.squaremilecoffee.com/) by Youtuber James Hoffmann, great channel to learn about coffee, but the beans are roasted too dark for my taste, so I prefer lighter roast bean from Origin.

## Interesting coffee beans

[Beanberry Coffee](https://www.beanberrycoffee.com/), they are UK's first speciality coffee roasters focused on organics.

## Random Observations

Dark roasted coffee beans are more brittle, less resistance when grinding.
Light roasted coffee beans are the opposite, there are harder to grind.
