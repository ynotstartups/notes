- **Major Scale** - whole, whole, half, whole, whole, whole, half
- **Minor Scale** - whole, half, whole, whole, half, whole, whole,

## Tonic

## Antecedent and Consequent in Melody

- **Antecedent / Question / Away Home** - a phase / period of melody doesn't end on the tonic
- **Consequent / Answer / Going Back Home** - a phase / period of melody ends on the tonic, usually the last bar

## Conjunct vs Disjunct Melody

- **Conjunct** - smooth motion of the music notes e.g. ode to joy
- **Disjunct** - many leaps of the music notes

## Dominant and Subdominant

- **Dominant** - 5th tonal degree, e.g. G in C, D, E, F, G, A, B
- **Subdominant** - 4th tonal degree, e.g. F in C, D, E, F, G, A, B

Dominant chord and Subdominant chord are triad built on the dominant or subdominant note, e.g. Dominant chord G+B+D, Subdominant chord F+A+C

Lots of music are made using dominant and subdominant chords.

1. Authentic cadence - Dominant chord (V) to tonic chord (I)
1. Half cadence - any cadence ending on Dominant chord (V)
1. Deceptive cadence - Dominant chord (V) to  submediant chord (VI)
1. Amen cadence - Subdominat Chord (IV) to tonic chord (I)

## Textures

- **Monophonic** - "Single" melodic line / single letter names for pitches
- **Homophonic** - with same sounding pitches i.e. with harmonic chord
- **polyphonic** - Generally independent musical line i.e. many sounding texture
