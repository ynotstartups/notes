This method increases the acidic qualities and structure in the final cup which is bursting full of apricot-like qualities.</p> <p>It\u2019s so exciting to see Virgulino trying new innovative practices on a farm that been central to our work for so many years.</p>"},{"location":"tasted-coffee-beans/#tuberosa-decaf","title":"Tuberosa Decaf","text":"<p>This coffee is decaffeinated using an all-natural Sugarcane process.</p> <p>Tuberosa is a collective effort by various small holders located in the Antioquia region of Colombia. Coffee from this region is special because it is grown in an ideal microclimate, with relatively cold weather and rich, mountainous soils. When choosing lots we look for coffees like Tuberosa that will work specifically well when decaffeinated; coffee that can undergo the Sugarcane process and still retain incredible flavour clarity in each cup.</p> <p>This coffee is decaffeinated using our new and the all-natural Sugarcane process. This involves pressurising and expanding the coffee beans with light steam, before it's rinsed in Ethanol Acetate (EA), an organic compound created by the fermentation of non-GMO Colombian sugarcane. Mountain water and steam are then added to remove any remaining caffeine before the coffee is dried and delivered to the local quality control lab to grade quality.</p>"},{"location":"tasted-coffee-beans/#barokah","title":"Barokah","text":"<p>The Barokah Cooperative sits at the foot of Mount Kerinci, the highest active volcano in Indonesia.

Despite the unique environment, the volcanic soil is extremely lush and fertile, making it the perfect terroir for growing outstanding coffee.</p> <p>The natural process requires the fewest number of steps at the washing station. Cherries are picked before being placed on patios to dry. They are then moved again onto raised beds which provides shade and better airflow.

The framing is done by the framing sub-layer of the HTTP/2 protocol. When a server wants to send an HTTP response, the response is processed by the framing sub-layer, where it is broken down into frames. The header field of the response becomes one frame, and the body of the message is broken down into one for more additional frames. The frames of the response are then interleaved by the framing sub-layer in the server with the frames of other responses and sent over the single persistent TCP connection. As the frames arrive at the client, they are first reassembled into the original response messages at the framing sub-layer and then processed by the browser as usual.

If the environment contains API keys in well-known locations, as is common with cloud providers, those secrets could be stolen easily.

HTTP is an application protocol (layer 7) that is transported over the TCP/IP (layer 4) networking protocol. Docker also supports services that listen on UDP/IP (layer 4). The Swarm routing mesh relies on IPVS, which routes and balances network traffic at layer 4.  The distinction between routing at layer 4 versus layer 7 is important. Because Swarm routes and load-balances connections at the IP layer, it means client connections will be balanced across backend service tasks, not HTTP requests. When one client Bypassing the routing mesh An alternate PublishMode called host bypasses the routing mesh and attachment to the ingress network. When using this mode, clients connect directly to the service task on a given host. If a task is deployed there, it can handle the connection; otherwise, the connection attempt will fail.  This PublishMode is likely most appropriate for services that are deployed in global mode so that there is one, and only one, task for a particular service on a cluster node. This ensures that a task is available to handle requests and avoids port collisions.

They describe where to find time, how to identify tasks, strategies for delegation and, most importantly, how to maintain the delicate balance of heads-down time in code and juggling their other responsibilities.</p> <p>A set of people does not make a team. It only exists as a group. A team is a set of people working towards a common goal. An effective leader aligns people towards that goal.</p> <p>Focus on growing developers, common practice is to meet one-on-one with each developer to find out</p> <ul> <li>what their interests are</li> <li>what motivates them</li> <li>what they consider their strengths   With this information, the Tech Lead constantly seeks ways to match interests and opportunities across the team.</li> </ul> <p>Appreciates different strengths that each person brings to the team.</p> <p>Make myself redundant: I work to ensure the team has the skills, knowledge, and experience to run itself. There are a couple of reasons for this: I want my teams to self-organise as much as possible; it gives them a greater feeling of empowerment. It meas the team can operate without an overseer, so I can have confidence, should I go on leave to get ill, that things will operate smoothly. Just as importantly, it also frees me up to look at boarder concerns and add more value at a higher level.</p> <p>My main worries as a Tech Lead are usually about people engagement. Technical problems are rarely insurmountable, in my experience. People problems are much more complex.</p> <p>The term Tech Lead is ambiguous: some consider the Tech Lead to be the lead programmer; some see it as a synonym of software architect. Whatever term you use, the role should focus on putting together the high-level architecture of the software system, taking care to understand any requirements or constraints that influence the architecture.</p> <p>Early on, I thought the only issues were code issues. Over the years, I have realised that the majority of our issues are communication issues.

Though I can still find it from git history.</p> <pre><code>$ ls ./todos-system/done/\n\nfoo.md # no epic folders such as `tech/`\n</code></pre> <p>Ticket orders</p> <p>In jira, you can drag tickets up and down to indicate order or priority of tickets.</p> <p>I prefix a number to the ticket <code>0_</code> to denote priority. For example, I can <code>mv foo.md 0_foo.md</code> to raise priority.</p> <p>Comments</p> <p>In jira, you can comment on a ticket for adding updates of investigation to the tickets.</p> <p>My implementation, prefix line with <code>C:</code>.</p> <p>Finally</p> <p>One benefit of this system is that everything can be done with basic file operations.</p> <p>An example folder layout:</p> <pre><code>todos-system/\n    todo/\n        foo.md\n    done/\n        bar.md\n    deleted/\n        baz.md\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"archive/todos-system/#cheat-sheet","title":"Cheat sheet","text":"<p>Assuming the current directory is <code>todo</code></p> Task Command create a new ticket <code>touch foo.md</code> add description <code>vim foo.md</code> see description of ticket <code>cat ticket.md</code> create a new epic <code>mkdir tech</code> move ticket to new epic <code>mv foo.md tech/</code> assign ticket to another epic <code>mv tech/foo.md notes/</code> list all tickets <code>ls -R -1</code> list tickets of specific epic <code>ls -1 tech/</code> delete a ticket <code>mv tech/foo.md ../deleted</code> assign a ticket to done <code>mv tech/foo.md ../done</code> filter out done tickets unnecessary <p>Related links</p> <p>See todo.txt TODO system for a more minimal way of setting up TODO system, it suggests prefixing <code>(A), (B), (C)</code> to indicate priority, maybe I can use this too.</p>"},{"location":"archive/what-have-I-done-in-lyst/","title":"What Have I done In Lyst?","text":"<p>Culture</p> <ul> <li>organised Vim London Meetup</li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Lyst Hibiscus Awards</p> <ul> <li>Prove Fast Hibiscus Award</li> <li>No 1 Impact Focus Lyst Hibiscus Award</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>part of tech culture group from 2019 - mid 2021</p> <ul> <li>organise and hosted MakingLyst (internal talk)</li> <li>helped relaunch MakingLyst - mid 2021</li> <li>three MakingLyst<ul> <li>Vim And How to tidy</li> <li>One year update on minimalism</li> <li>JAMStack presentation</li> </ul> </li> <li>two internal blog posts<ul> <li>python strict typing</li> <li>hackday 2021</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>organised 2 hackdays (2019, 2020)</li> </ul> <ul> <li>participated in 3 hackdays (2019, 2020, 2021)</li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p>Contributed to App Backend Sync</p> <ul> <li>advocated for having stand ups in backend sync</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <ul> <li>Leaded pair programming interview</li> </ul> <ul> <li>started writing on Dec/2021</li> </ul> <p>Tech</p> <ul> <li>moved from Full Stack to Full Stack + iOS App Engineer to Backend Engineer</li> <li>Advocated for adapting stricter typing in python</li> <li>Advocated for passing client from views</li> <li>Advocated for writing documentations</li> <li>features<ul> <li>home tab (productionize ranking, )</li> <li>internal curator tool</li> <li>user taste profile</li> </ul> </li> <li>contributed to monolith</li> <li>created one internal micro-service</li> <li>maintained one public micro-service</li> </ul> <p>Tech Lead</p> <ul> <li>started to add more details jira tickets</li> </ul> <p>Progression</p> <ul> <li>1.3 -&gt; 2.1 -&gt; 2.1 + tech lead</li> </ul>"},{"location":"archive/wisdom/","title":"Random Wisdoms","text":""},{"location":"archive/wisdom/#on-life","title":"On Life","text":"<p>Learn and do things that benefit me for the rest of my life, such as vim, Linux, personal finance..</p> <p>The most precious thing you can give away is your time.</p> <p>Discover the life that I want other than merely copying from other people.</p> <p>If you read news the world is hell, if you don't read news the world is heaven.</p> <p>Lots of people go to the gym to hedge against the unhealthy lifestyle</p> <p>Computer programs are all about automation, whenever you find yourselves repeating, find a way to automate it.</p> <p>It's less about how shiny the tool is, it is about how deep you understand the tool.
